# Blog-SQL

## Background & Objectives
The goal of this challenge is to query the database **from our Python code**.

## Data
We will work with the ecommerce.sqlite database available at this URL:
`https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/sql_databases/blog.sqlite`

## Tools
For that we will use a library that comes with Python, called **sqlite3**, a Jupyter Notebook and DBeaver to connect to the database and use a SQL Editor to build and test the SQL queries.
